	#TODO for today
	Create a small Scraper for covid numbers...
	Add Resources for simple scrapping and move towards sentimental analysis

	Figure out a structure and increase The resources...For Project Management
	Startup Handbook..Complete Consideration of what and when and how something can be done..


	Also consider planning out a template structure on how to do POCs(proof of concepting)
	RCA (Root Cause Analysis..)

	A simple checklist to develop a feature, a task
	Merely Explaining a meta for a unit and attaching it to a composition of meta and explaining them further..



	For what I have understood right now..
	A unit will be an isolated entity in my system....It can be a person, object, anything..
	A unit might be a composition of different set of units..
	A unit might be a subset(part/contribution) to creation of some other UNIT.
	This complex structure needs to be unified under properly maintained STATUS, History to make it work.
