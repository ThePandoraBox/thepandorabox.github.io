	# TODO
	An indefinite project Structure. The Structure should include and indexed readme, pointing to the proper location of sub-readme in the project. The track sheets and executions sheets should be bound accordingly.
	The aim is to increase the community to make a tool available to everyone that can make sense of the vast information available through internet and surface it in a human readable sized content.
		<ol>
			<li>Language Folder</li>
			<li>Bootstrap Script to quickly check the current setup of the system and what else will be required to run the next command</li>
			<li>List of all the services. Possible with the current Machine architecture and installation. Since there is a possibility that some of the applications might require different set of package. IT should be clearly mentioned which versions to be installed and of what. But the whole setup/troubleshooting should be done using single command.</li>
			<li>Commands and chronological setup of tasks possible</li>
			<li>Aiming at commiting some scrappers in plain JAVA or Python Language</li>
